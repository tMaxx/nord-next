### What is this?

This is a slight reorganization of the original [Nord JetBrains](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-jetbrains) plugin, updated, modified and extended to suit my personal use case.

You could treat it as a collection of things I use in my day-to-day work, that should still be usable if you're not me.

**It is not aimed to be compatible or in sync with the original Nord**, but we'll see how things go.

### Contains:
- Nord Next color scheme with slighly adjusted colors and fixed inheritances
- Oceanic Next Nord-ified color scheme
- Nord Darker theme with adjusted colors of panels to be a little darker
- ...and some original Nord theme(s)

You might want to use [Atom Material Icons](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10044-atom-material-icons) with this theme collection, it looks awesome IMO.

### Author's ramblings

- I might try to sneak in some keybindings I use. XWin ones. On Windows. Adventure awaits.
- I'll be trying to maintain it as new things appear, but since this is just a couple of text files, it shouldn't be hard... Right?
- Idea of `Darker` themes shamelessly stolen from that one awesome Material UI theme that stopped being awesome when it became paid. I really liked the Oceanic variant, but Nord is better, because it's free.
