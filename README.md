### What is this?

This is a slight reorganization of the original [Nord JetBrains](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-jetbrains) plugin, updated, modified and extended to suit my personal use case.  
You could treat it as a collection of things I use in my day-to-day work, that should still be usable if you're not me.

### Contains:
- Oceanic Next Nord-ified color scheme
- Nord Darker theme with adjusted colors of panels to be a little darker
- ...and some original Nord theme(s)

### Author's ramblings

- Currently focused on getting this into JetBrains plugin marketplace. We'll see how things go. 
- I might try to sneak in some keybindings I use. XWin ones. On Windows. Adventure awaits.
- I'll be trying to maintain it as new things appear, but since this is just a couple of text files, it shouldn't be hard... Right?
